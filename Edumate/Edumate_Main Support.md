# Edumate student information system
Edumate is our student information system used to manage student enrolment and academic records.

Each school has a production and playschool test environment. Playschool can be used to test functionality without impacting live data.

Announcements regarding Edumate are generally posted to Registrars, Fee Advisors and academic support staff using their SharePoint team sites. More general announcements will be posted on this site.
