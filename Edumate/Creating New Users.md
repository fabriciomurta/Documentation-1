# Creating New Users

==- If staff exists in Edumate, but not as a staff member
To create new staff (as users) as contacts in Edumate - if your staff already exist in Edumate, but not as a staff member:
- First use the contact search at the top of the Edumate screen, to make sure that they do not already exist in your Edumate.  They may be a past student, or current carer.  You do not need to create a new record for them.  
- Go to the contact's group tab, and tick them as 'staff'.  Press save and then refresh the screen.  Your contact will now have a staff tab.
- On the contact's group tab you will also need to tick them as 'user'.  Press save and then refresh the screen.  Your contact will now have a access tab. For you to set up account settings (as per below).   P​​lease note, that you CAN NOT untick these once you have saved.  Each tab stores historical data that is then part of a person's profile forever.  Be sure you are ticking the right tick boxes!
- Now navigate to their staff tab and complete their start date, employment type, etc - Press Save.
- On a staff member's general tab their is a shortname field.  This needs to be completed for all staff, as this is used for photo importing as well as being able to roster and timetable staff.
- Email note:  please note on the General tab you are to store their school issued email address (this is the email account Edumate will use to send emails from and to).  Under their staff tab, this is where you store their personal/home account email address.  This is for record keeping only, Edumate does not use this email address.

==- Create new staff member from scratch
To create new staff as contacts in Edumate - if the contact does not already exist in Edumate:
- Go to the plus on the right side.
- Go to contacts.
- Select staff.
- Enter all details you have working through the tabs – press save after the first tab, as it will help populate information you need on the group tab.
- On the contact's group tab you will also need to tick them as 'user'.  Press save and then refresh the screen.  Your contact will now have a access tab. For you to set up account settings (as per below).   P​​lease note, that you CAN NOT untick these once you have saved.  Each tab stores historical data that is then part of a person's profile forever.  Be sure you are ticking the right tick boxes!
- Now navigate to their staff tab and complete their start date, employment type, etc - Press Save.

==- To make a teacher
To ma​​​ke a teacher, a teacher in Edumate you will need to:
- Give them a shortname – this will be the first three letters of their surname, followed by the first two letters of their firstname ie mine is DAWSA.  You will do this under their 'General Tab' in a field named 'Short Name'.  Although this field is primarily used for teachers, it is also used for importing photgraphs from school photo day.  Please give a shortname code to ALL staff.
- Under the groups tab, you will need to tick that they are a 'user', 'staff' and 'teacher' (admin only need 'staff' and 'user').
- Add them to at least '*staff (all current) group and for teachers *staff - teaching.
- Press save.

## Access Tab - for all staff
- The instructions above indicate going to a staff member's group tab and ticking 'user'.  Once this is complete, press SAVE and then click on reload/refresh, then an 'Access Tab' will appear.
- In here type in their username to match how they log into your school network.  If you are unsure, look up your own access tab :) or check with your IT staff.
- Tick that they are an active account (save if you have LDAP)
- **For schools without LDAP continue...**
	+ Type in a temporary password - I recommend Welcome1 as the default to enter, so you can easily assist new staff where needed.
	+ You will need to retype the temporary password into the second password field to confirm.
	+ Click on password never expires.
	+ Click on force password change.
	+ Click on Do Not Use LDAP.
	+ Press save.

## Introducing Staff to Edumate

[This will be updated for 2017 and more information will be provided.]

A report has been set up in Edumate to run based on a staff member's start date.  Whether you choose to email them before they start, or on the day they start the choice is yours.
- Go to Setup > Reports > General Reports > Correspondence Tab > Portal - Staff Welcome Letter.
- Copy of the letter for your info:  Welcome_to_Edumate_Staff_Letter (6).sxw - the report will give staff their username, the Welcome1 password (so may need to adapt for LDAP schools), the URL to access Edumate as well as basic information like using google chrome, how to create a shortcut, etc.  It also includes a link to the 'Edumate Overview' training session that Hobsons conducted and a link to how to mark a roll for teaching staff.  
- You will want to set up a scheduled correspondence report.  With a relative date.  If you want new staff to get it on their first day of work, you will select 'as at date'.
