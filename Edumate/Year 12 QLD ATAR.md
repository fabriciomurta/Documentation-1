# Year 12 QLD - ATAR - Courses for 2020 (Edval > Edumate > Canvas)

In preparation for 2020, ALL Qld Colleges are going to be required to create new Courses in Edumate, to accommodate the curriculum/syllabi changes for the new ATAR.  New Year 12 courses will need to be created for ALL Year 12 general subjects that are being offered by your College.  Colleges may also require to do this for Year 10 courses as well, if the College will be implementing ATAR for the first time in 2020 for Year 10.

## Why?  

Due to the change in numercial results from a grade result previously used, new courses (linked to subjects that were created for Year 11 2019 courses) will need to be created and linked into the Senior subjects.  Failure to do this prior to your first sync will result in a domino effect of wrongly linked course/class information from Edumate into Canvas.  In 2019 for some of our Colleges we saw the need to manually massage these changes through which did in some cases result in a loss of markbook data, as it was associated with the wrong courses (in both Edumate and Canvas).  This only affected a handful of staff.  However, if we plan, we can avoid this completely!

## When?

New Courses will need to be created prior to the first Edval / Edumate sync for 2020. Which means that current Year 12 courses that are being replaced by the new ATAR will need to be 'retired'.  The current Year 12 2019 courses will not be able to be retired until Semester Reporting for 2019 has been finalised for your Year 12 cohort.

## Checklist of tasks to manage this process:

1. At the end of 2019 Semester Reporting, identify Year 12 2019 courses in Edumate that will retiring.  [Retire the courses](https://ccm.instructure.com/courses/2711/pages/courses-creating-and-editing?module_item_id=38384) with the following guidelines:
	a. Update course name with the suffix of "(pre 2020)".
	b. Update class code base with an 'X'.
2. Identify and create Year 12 2020 General [courses in Edumate](https://ccm.instructure.com/courses/2711/pages/courses-why?module_item_id=38338).  Unique names and codes will be required to do this, if replacing existing ones.  Please note, it is possible to do this step ahead of Step 1.  However you will need to temporarily add additional information in order to create the 'unique' values as required by Edumate as per below.  This however, will need to be removed prior to an Edval / Edumate Sync and will be able to be completed once current courses have been retired.
	a. Include in course name suffix of "(2020)".
	b. Include in class code base "2020".
